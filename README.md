Wake Me Up - Pebble app
===========================

This app was created with Catherina Xu at Treehacks Winter 2015, and it won one of the Dropbox Engineering Awards.  We are currently working on expanding it and adding more features.

Ever miss a train stop because you were snoozing? Ever refrained from napping on public transportation because you were anxious? Wake Me Up combines your phone + Pebble and makes sure that you wake up before your stop. The app uses the Google Play Services API and tracks your location over time through your Android device, updating every 5 seconds and displaying crucial travel data such as speed, destination, and geographical coordinates. When you are within a certain radius of your destination (currently supports various Caltrain stations), your Pebble will buzz on your wrist until you have woken up and silenced it.

Intended for anyone and everyone who wants to catch a good nap on a long train, car, or bus ride!
